# 💼 Job Portal Application

A modern, responsive, and fully functional **Job Portal application** built using **Angular 21** and **Angular Material**.

This project uses a **mock REST API backend powered by json-server** to simulate real-world data interactions like job browsing, applying for positions, and a protected company dashboard for posting new jobs.

## \uD83D\uDE80 Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to run the project locally.

---

# 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

### Install Node.js
Download from:

```

[https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

````

Check versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
````

### Install Angular CLI

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
ng version
```

---

# 📥 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder

```bash
cd job-portal
```

### 3️⃣ Install project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

# 💻 Run the Project Locally

⚠️ The project requires **two servers running simultaneously**:

1. **Mock Backend Server**
2. **Angular Frontend Server**

---

# ▶️ Step 1: Start the Mock Database Server

Run the following command in the project root directory.

```bash
npm run server
```

This starts **json-server** and serves data from:

```
db.json
```

Server URL:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

# ▶️ Step 2: Start Angular Development Server

Open a **second terminal window** in the project root folder and run:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
ng serve
```

Angular development server will start at:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

---

# 🌐 Open the Application

Once both servers are running, open your browser:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

The application supports **live reload**, so changes in code will automatically refresh the page.
